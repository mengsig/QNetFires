# Budget Enforcement and Raster Cycling Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Budget Enforcement Issue
**Problem**: Environments were placing 2300+ fuel breaks instead of respecting the 250 budget limit.

**Root Cause**: The `DummyEnv` in `train_threaded_parallel.py` was using a simple step counter (`steps >= 20`) instead of tracking actual fuel break usage.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed `DummyEnv` to properly track fuel breaks used and respect the budget constraint
- Added budget parameter to `ThreadedVectorEnv` constructor
- Modified dummy environment to count fuel breaks from actions and terminate when budget is exceeded

```python
class DummyEnv:
    def __init__(self, budget=250):
        self.budget = budget
        self.fuel_breaks_used = 0
    
    def step(self, action):
        # Count fuel breaks from action
        action_array = np.asarray(action).reshape(-1)
        new_breaks = min(np.sum(action_array > 0.5), 10)  # Max 10 per step
        self.fuel_breaks_used += new_breaks
        
        # Done when budget is exceeded (like real environment)
        done = self.fuel_breaks_used >= self.budget
```

### 2. Raster Cycling Issue
**Problem**: The training script was only loading rasters once at the beginning, not cycling through different rasters to ensure generalization.

**Root Cause**: No mechanism was in place to refresh the raster selection during training.

**Solution**: 
- Added raster cycling every 10 episodes
- Properly closes old environments and creates new ones with fresh rasters
- Added logging to track raster changes

```python
# Cycle rasters every 10 episodes to ensure generalization
if episode % 10 == 0 and episode > 0:
    print(f"\nðŸ”„ Cycling rasters at episode {episode}...")
    # Get new rasters
    selected_rasters = raster_manager.get_random_rasters(N_ENVS)
    
    # Close old environment
    vec_env.close()
    
    # Create new environments with new rasters
    env_fns = [
        make_env_with_raster(raster, BUDGET, K_STEPS, SIMS, seed=episode*N_ENVS + i) 
        for i, raster in enumerate(selected_rasters)
    ]
    
    vec_env = ThreadedVectorEnv(env_fns, budget=BUDGET)
    obs = vec_env.reset()
```

## Additional Improvements

### 3. Data Type Consistency
- Fixed tensor data type issues that caused `RuntimeError: Found dtype Float but expected Double`
- Ensured all numpy arrays are converted to `float32` before tensor creation
- Added explicit type conversion in replay buffer and loss computation

### 4. Better Logging
- Added raster selection logging to verify cycling is working
- Added budget tracking in episode summaries
- Improved environment creation success/failure reporting

## Expected Results

After these fixes, you should see:

1. **Proper Budget Enforcement**: Episodes will end when ~250 fuel breaks are placed, not 2300+
2. **Raster Cycling**: Every 10 episodes, you'll see "ðŸ”„ Cycling rasters" messages
3. **Varied Learning**: Different rasters will provide different challenges, improving generalization
4. **Stable Training**: No more data type errors or excessive fuel break placement

## Usage

The fixed `train_threaded_parallel.py` now properly:
- Respects the 250 fuel break budget
- Cycles through different rasters every 10 episodes
- Handles data types correctly
- Provides better logging for debugging

```bash
python3 train_threaded_parallel.py
```

You should now see realistic episode summaries like:
```
ðŸ“Š Episode Summary: Initial=731.0, Final=350.2, Reduction=52.1%, Breaks=248, Efficiency=2.10
```

Instead of the problematic:
```
ðŸ“Š Episode Summary: Initial=731.0, Final=0.0, Reduction=100.0%, Breaks=2367, Efficiency=1.06
```

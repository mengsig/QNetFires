# Strict Budget Enforcement Fix

## Problem
Environments were placing 330-350+ fuel breaks instead of respecting the 250 budget limit, even after previous fixes.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Training Loop Issue**: `STEPS_PER_EP = 2` was too small, causing environments to auto-reset before completing episodes naturally
2. **Auto-Reset Problem**: Gym wrappers were automatically resetting completed environments, allowing them to continue placing fuel breaks
3. **Budget Tracking**: No strict enforcement at the wrapper level to prevent budget violations

## Solution Applied

### 1. Increased Steps Per Episode
```python
STEPS_PER_EP = 30  # Allow episodes to complete naturally (250 budget / 10 per step = 25 steps)
```

### 2. Custom Budget Enforcement Wrapper
Created `BudgetEnforcementWrapper` that:
- Tracks total fuel breaks used across the episode
- Strictly enforces budget limit
- Prevents further actions once budget is reached
- Does NOT auto-reset when done

```python
class BudgetEnforcementWrapper:
    def __init__(self, env):
        self.env = env
        self.is_done = False
        self.total_fuel_breaks = 0
        
    def step(self, action):
        if self.is_done:
            # Return dummy result if already done
            obs = self.env._make_obs()
            return obs, 0.0, True, False, {"burned": 0.0, "new_cells": 0, "budget_exceeded": True}
        
        obs, reward, done, truncated, info = self.env.step(action)
        
        # Track fuel breaks
        new_cells = info.get("new_cells", 0)
        self.total_fuel_breaks += new_cells
        
        # Enforce budget strictly
        if self.total_fuel_breaks >= budget:
            done = True
            self.is_done = True
            
        # Update info with accurate count
        info["total_fuel_breaks"] = self.total_fuel_breaks
        
        return obs, reward, done, truncated, info
```

### 3. Enhanced Training Loop
- Tracks which environments are still active
- Stops stepping completed environments
- Breaks early when all environments are done
- Better logging of completion status

### 4. Improved Logging
- Shows total fuel breaks used per environment
- Distinguishes between REAL and DUMMY environments
- Tracks budget compliance

## Expected Results

Now you should see:
```
ðŸŽ¯ Environment 0 (REAL) completed: Burned=350.2, Total Breaks=250/250, Step=25
ðŸŽ¯ Environment 1 (REAL) completed: Burned=420.1, Total Breaks=248/250, Step=24
âœ… All environments completed at step 25

ðŸ“Š Episode Summary: Initial=731.0, Final=350.2, Reduction=52.1%, Breaks=250, Efficiency=2.10
```

Instead of:
```
ðŸ“Š Episode Summary: Initial=731.0, Final=0.0, Reduction=100.0%, Breaks=337, Efficiency=1.06
```

## Key Changes
1. **Strict Budget Enforcement**: No environment can exceed the 250 fuel break limit
2. **Natural Episode Completion**: Episodes complete when budget is reached, not after arbitrary steps
3. **No Auto-Reset**: Completed environments stay done until explicitly reset
4. **Accurate Tracking**: Total fuel breaks are tracked at the wrapper level

## Usage
```bash
python3 train_threaded_parallel.py
```

The training will now respect the 250 fuel break budget strictly across all environments.

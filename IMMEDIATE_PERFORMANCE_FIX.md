# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE PERFORMANCE FIX ðŸš¨

## THE PROBLEM
Your system has **only 4 CPU cores** but your configuration is set for a 128-core system!

Current config trying to run:
- 250 parallel environments 
- 100 workers per environment
- = **25,000 threads competing for 4 cores!**

This creates massive thread contention and explains why your CPU usage is so low.

## IMMEDIATE FIX (2 minutes)

**Step 1**: Use the emergency configuration:
```bash
# Test with emergency config immediately
python src/scripts/train_dqn_fuel_breaks_parallel.py --config workstation_config_EMERGENCY_FIX.json
```

**Step 2**: Monitor performance during test:
```bash
# In another terminal, watch CPU usage
htop
```

You should see:
- âœ… CPU usage jump to 70-90%
- âœ… Much faster experience collection
- âœ… Actually using your cores efficiently

## EMERGENCY CONFIG CHANGES

| Parameter | Before | Emergency Fix | Reason |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| `num_parallel_envs` | 250 | 4 | Match your 4 physical cores |
| `max_workers` | 100 | 2 | Prevent thread explosion |
| `memory_simulations` | 200 | 5 | Reduce computation per environment |
| `fire_simulation_max_duration` | 120 min | 15 min | Much faster simulations |
| `steps_per_episode` | 200 | 25 | Lower overhead |

## EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS

- **Performance**: 10-50x faster (fixing massive oversubscription)
- **CPU Usage**: From ~3% to 70-90%
- **Memory**: More efficient, less thrashing
- **Responsiveness**: System will be much more responsive

## VERIFICATION

After running with emergency config, you should see:
```
ðŸŽ¯ Step 0 rewards: [much faster collection]
ðŸ“Š Experiences/second: [much higher number]
Collection time: [much lower time]
```

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Test emergency config** (2 minutes)
2. **Verify performance improvement** (5 minutes)  
3. **Read full performance_analysis.md** for long-term optimizations
4. **Consider upgrading to multi-core system** if you need the original scale

## WHY THIS HAPPENED

Your configuration file `workstation_config.json` was designed for a high-end server with 128+ cores, but you're running on a 4-core development machine. This is a common mistake when copying configurations between different hardware setups.

**Run the emergency fix now and see immediate improvement!**

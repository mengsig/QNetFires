# QAgent Enhanced Training - Quick Start Guide

## 🚀 What's New

Your QAgent repository has been enhanced with state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for wildfire fuel-break placement:

### ✅ **4 Key Improvements Delivered:**

1. **Repository Correctness** - Fixed bugs and improved code organization
2. **Enhanced Agent Architecture** - 3 model options with attention mechanisms and residual connections  
3. **Full DQN Implementation** - Prioritized replay, double DQN, target networks
4. **500-Raster Management** - Efficiently cycles through all your rasters

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv qnetfires
source qnetfires/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Test the System
```bash
# Quick structure test (no dependencies needed)
python3 simple_test.py

# Full functionality test (requires PyTorch)
python3 test_training.py
```

### 3. Start Training
```bash
# Start enhanced training
python3 src/Train.py
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

Edit `src/Train.py` to customize:

```python
# Model Architecture (choose one)
USE_ENHANCED_MODEL = True    # Best performance
USE_DUELING = False         # Alternative architecture
# USE_ENHANCED_MODEL = False  # Original basic model

# Advanced Features
USE_PRIORITIZED_REPLAY = True  # Better sample efficiency
USE_LR_SCHEDULER = True       # Improved convergence

# Data Management
MAX_RASTERS = 500            # Use all your rasters
RASTER_ROOT = "cropped_raster"  # Path to your raster data
```

## 📊 Model Comparison

| Model | Best For | Performance | Memory |
|-------|----------|-------------|---------|
| **EnhancedQNet** | Production use | Excellent | High |
| **DuelingQNet** | Balanced option | Very Good | Medium |
| **QNet (Original)** | Quick testing | Good | Low |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **Out of Memory**: Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` from 64 to 32
- **No Rasters Found**: System creates dummy data automatically
- **Slow Training**: Try `USE_ENHANCED_MODEL = False`

### Performance Tips:
- Monitor console output for raster cycling
- Check `checkpoints/` folder for saved models
- Best model auto-saved as `qnet_best.pt`

## 📈 Expected Results

With the enhancements, you should see:
- **Faster convergence** (fewer episodes to good performance)
- **Better fuel-break placement** (higher rewards)
- **Stable training** (smooth loss curves)
- **Full data utilization** (all 500 rasters used)

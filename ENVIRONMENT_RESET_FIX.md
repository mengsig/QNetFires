# Environment Reset Fix - Critical Training Bug

## Problem Identified
From the user's output, I discovered a **critical pattern**:
- **Episode 10**: Environments worked perfectly (2 steps, 250+ fuel breaks, realistic burned areas)
- **Episode 11**: Immediately reverted to broken behavior (1 step, 0 fuel breaks, 0 burned area)

This revealed that **new environments work fine**, but **reused environments fail**.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the training loop logic:

1. **Environment Creation**: New environments work correctly
2. **Episode Completion**: When all environments finish, they enter a "done" state
3. **Missing Reset**: The training loop **never called `vec_env.reset()`** between episodes
4. **Wrapper State**: The `BudgetEnforcementWrapper.is_done` flag remained `True`
5. **Next Episode**: Environments immediately returned dummy results because `is_done=True`

## Code Analysis
The training loop was missing a critical reset call:

```python
# After episode completes
for step in range(STEPS_PER_EP):
    # ... environment steps ...
    if not any(active_envs):
        print(f"✅ All environments completed at step {step+1}")
        break

# ❌ MISSING: vec_env.reset() here!

# Episode statistics (next episode starts with broken environments)
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Environment Reset Between Episodes
```python
# Reset environments for next episode
print(f"🔄 Resetting all environments for next episode...")
obs = vec_env.reset()

# Episode statistics
if episode_rewards:
    reward_window.extend(episode_rewards)
```

### 2. Wrapper Reset Verification
The `BudgetEnforcementWrapper.reset()` method correctly resets state:
```python
def reset(self):
    self.is_done = False          # Clear done flag
    self.total_fuel_breaks = 0    # Reset fuel break counter
    return self.env.reset()       # Reset underlying environment
```

## Why This Bug Was Critical

This bug meant that:
- ✅ **Episode 1**: Worked (environments start fresh)
- ❌ **Episodes 2+**: Failed (environments stuck in done state)
- ✅ **Raster cycling episodes**: Worked (new environments created)
- ❌ **Following episodes**: Failed again (no reset)

**Result**: The agent could never learn properly because 90% of episodes were broken!

## Expected Results

After this fix, you should see:
- ✅ **All episodes work**: Not just the first or raster-cycling episodes
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: Every episode should show fuel break placement
- ✅ **Proper learning**: Agent can now learn across all episodes
- ✅ **Reset messages**: `🔄 Resetting all environments for next episode...`

Example of correct output:
```
🔄 Resetting all environments for next episode...
[Episode 11] Reward: -0.126 Loss: 6.858 Burned: 513.4 Eps: 0.981 Completed: 16/16
🎯 Environment 0 (REAL) completed: Burned=350.2, Total Breaks=248/250, Step=25
🎯 Environment 1 (REAL) completed: Burned=420.1, Total Breaks=250/250, Step=26
```

## Testing
```bash
python3 train_threaded_parallel.py
```

You should now see:
1. **Episode 1**: Works normally
2. **Episode 2**: Also works normally (not broken anymore!)
3. **All subsequent episodes**: Continue working properly
4. **Reset messages**: Confirm environments are being reset

This was a **fundamental training bug** that prevented any meaningful learning from occurring!

# Environment Reshuffling Bug Fix Summary

## 🐛 **The Problem**
The user reported that environment reshuffling didn't happen even once in 440 episodes, despite the code being designed to randomly select environments at every episode. This meant the agent was seeing the same landscape configurations repeatedly, reducing training diversity.

## 🔍 **Root Causes Identified**

### 1. **Lambda Closure Bug**
**Issue**: Classic Python lambda closure problem in `_reshuffle_environments()` method.

**Problem Code**:
```python
for i in range(self.num_parallel_envs):
    landscape_idx = new_indices[i]
    landscape_data = self.landscape_data_list[landscape_idx]
    
    env_fn = lambda idx=i, data=landscape_data: SingleFireEnvWrapper(
        landscape_data=copy.deepcopy(data),
        env_id=idx,
        num_simulations=self.num_simulations,
        max_duration=self.max_duration
    )
    env_fns.append(env_fn)
```

**What went wrong**: All lambda functions captured the variables `i` and `landscape_data` by reference, not by value. This means all lambdas ended up using the same values (the last ones from the loop).

### 2. **Fixed Random Seed Issue**
**Issue**: The `optimized_config.json` contained `"random_seed": 42`, which seeded the random number generator with a fixed value.

**What went wrong**: This caused the same sequence of "random" numbers to be generated every time the training script ran, resulting in identical environment selections across episodes.

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### 1. **Fixed Lambda Closure Bug**
**New Code**:
```python
def _create_env_function(self, env_id: int, landscape_data: Dict):
    """Create environment function with proper closure."""
    def env_fn():
        return SingleFireEnvWrapper(
            landscape_data=copy.deepcopy(landscape_data),
            env_id=env_id,
            num_simulations=self.num_simulations,
            max_duration=self.max_duration
        )
    return env_fn

def _reshuffle_environments(self):
    # ...
    for i in range(self.num_parallel_envs):
        landscape_idx = new_indices[i]
        landscape_data = self.landscape_data_list[landscape_idx]
        
        # Use proper function closure to avoid lambda capture issues
        env_fn = self._create_env_function(i, landscape_data)
        env_fns.append(env_fn)
```

**Why this fixes it**: The helper function `_create_env_function` creates a proper closure that captures the values at function creation time, not by reference.

### 2. **Fixed Random Seed Issue**
**Configuration Change**:
```json
// Before (in optimized_config.json):
"random_seed": 42,

// After:
// (removed the line entirely)
```

**Environment Selection Enhancement**:
```python
def _select_random_environments(self) -> List[int]:
    """Randomly select environments from available landscapes with time-based seeding."""
    # Use time-based seeding for truly random environment selection
    import time
    time_seed = int(time.time() * 1000000) % 2**32  # Use microseconds for better randomness
    env_random = random.Random(time_seed)
    
    if self.num_parallel_envs <= self.total_available_landscapes:
        selected_indices = env_random.sample(
            range(self.total_available_landscapes), 
            self.num_parallel_envs
        )
    else:
        selected_indices = [
            env_random.randint(0, self.total_available_landscapes - 1)
            for _ in range(self.num_parallel_envs)
        ]
    
    return selected_indices
```

**Why this fixes it**: Uses a separate `random.Random()` instance with time-based seeding, ensuring truly random environment selection regardless of global random state.

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging and Monitoring**
**Added comprehensive logging**:
```python
def reset(self, **kwargs):
    # Store previous selection for comparison
    previous_selection = getattr(self, 'selected_landscape_indices', None)
    
    # Reshuffle environments
    self._reshuffle_environments()
    
    # Verify that environments actually changed
    if previous_selection is not None:
        if self.selected_landscape_indices != previous_selection:
            print(f"✅ Environment selection changed: {previous_selection} → {self.selected_landscape_indices}")
        else:
            print(f"⚠️ Environment selection unchanged: {self.selected_landscape_indices}")
```

**Enhanced statistics tracking**:
```python
def get_performance_stats(self) -> Dict:
    # Calculate environment usage frequency
    usage_frequency = {}
    for env_idx in environments_used:
        usage_frequency[env_idx] = usage_frequency.get(env_idx, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate diversity metrics
    diversity_percentage = (len(unique_environments) / self.total_available_landscapes) * 100
    
    return {
        'diversity_percentage': diversity_percentage,
        'environment_usage_frequency': usage_frequency,
        'total_environment_selections': len(environments_used),
        # ... other stats
    }
```

## 🎯 **Implementation Details**

### Environment Selection Flow
1. **Every Episode**: `reset()` method calls `_reshuffle_environments()`
2. **Random Selection**: `_select_random_environments()` uses time-based seeding
3. **Proper Closure**: `_create_env_function()` creates environment functions correctly
4. **New Environments**: Fresh `SyncVectorEnv` created with new landscape combinations
5. **Verification**: Logging confirms environment changes

### Key Improvements
- **Maximum Diversity**: Environments randomly selected at every episode
- **True Randomness**: Time-based seeding ensures different selections
- **Proper Closure**: Lambda bug fixed with helper function
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Comprehensive diversity statistics
- **Better Logging**: Real-time verification of environment changes

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### Before Fix
- Same environments every episode
- 0% diversity across episodes
- Agent sees identical landscapes repeatedly
- Poor generalization

### After Fix
- Random environments every episode
- High diversity across episodes (approaching 100% if enough episodes)
- Agent sees different landscape combinations
- Better generalization and robustness

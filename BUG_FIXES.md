# Bug Fixes for QAgent Training

## Issue Resolved: AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fill_'

### Problem Description
The training was failing during model initialization with the error:
```
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'fill_'
```

This occurred in the `_initialize_weights()` method of the `EnhancedQNet` class when trying to initialize bias terms that don't exist.

### Root Cause
Some layers (particularly BatchNorm layers) can have `bias=None` when created with `bias=False`, but the initialization code was trying to initialize all bias terms without checking if they exist.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Fixed Weight Initialization in Model.py
**Before:**
```python
def _initialize_weights(self):
    for m in self.modules():
        if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(m.weight)
            if m.bias is not None:
                nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)
        elif isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
            nn.init.constant_(m.weight, 1)
            nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)  # ❌ This could fail!
        elif isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(m.weight)
            nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)  # ❌ This could fail!
```

**After:**
```python
def _initialize_weights(self):
    for m in self.modules():
        if isinstance(m, nn.Conv2d):
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(m.weight)
            if m.bias is not None:
                nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)
        elif isinstance(m, nn.BatchNorm2d):
            nn.init.constant_(m.weight, 1)
            if m.bias is not None:  # ✅ Check if bias exists
                nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)
        elif isinstance(m, nn.Linear):
            nn.init.xavier_uniform_(m.weight)
            if m.bias is not None:  # ✅ Check if bias exists
                nn.init.constant_(m.bias, 0)
```

#### 2. Fixed Device Handling in Train.py
**Issues:**
- `DEVICE` was being set globally, causing issues with multiprocessing
- Device references needed to be passed as parameters to functions

**Fixes:**
- Moved `DEVICE` selection into the `main()` function
- Added `device` parameter to `compute_q_loss()` and `choose_actions_batch()`
- Updated all function calls to pass the device parameter
- Fixed tensor device placement in prioritized replay buffer

#### 3. Enhanced Multiprocessing Stability
**Added:**
- Proper random seed setting in subprocess environments
- Better error handling for CUDA initialization in multiprocessing

### Testing the Fix

Run the following to verify the fix:

```bash
# Test model initialization specifically
python3 test_model_fix.py

# Test overall structure
python3 simple_test.py

# Run full training (should now work)
python3 src/Train.py
```

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Model Initialization**: All three model architectures (QNet, EnhancedQNet, DuelingQNet) should initialize without errors
2. **Training Start**: The training should proceed past model initialization and begin loading environments
3. **CUDA Support**: Should work properly with both CPU and CUDA devices
4. **Multiprocessing**: Environments should initialize correctly in parallel processes

### Files Modified

1. **`src/Model.py`**: Fixed `_initialize_weights()` method
2. **`src/Train.py`**: Fixed device handling and multiprocessing issues
3. **`test_model_fix.py`**: Added specific test for the initialization fix
4. **`BUG_FIXES.md`**: This documentation

### Verification Steps

1. ✅ Model initialization completes without AttributeError
2. ✅ All three model architectures work correctly
3. ✅ Forward pass through models succeeds
4. ✅ Device placement works for both CPU and CUDA
5. ✅ Multiprocessing environments initialize properly

The training should now proceed successfully with all 500 rasters being loaded and used for enhanced DQN training.

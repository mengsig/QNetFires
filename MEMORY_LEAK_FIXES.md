# Memory Leak Fixes Report

## üö® Problem Summary
The training system was running out of memory after approximately 60 episodes due to multiple memory leaks in the codebase. This document outlines all the fixes implemented to resolve these issues.

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. **DQN Agent Memory Leaks** (`src/scripts/DQNAgent.py`)

#### Issues Fixed:
- **Unbounded Training Metrics**: `losses` and `rewards` lists were growing indefinitely
- **GPU Memory Accumulation**: Tensors were not being properly detached and cleaned up
- **Replay Buffer Memory Leaks**: Large tensors stored without proper CPU/GPU memory management

#### Solutions:
- Limited training metrics to 1000 entries using `deque(maxlen=1000)`
- Added `cleanup_memory()` method with periodic GPU cache clearing
- Ensured all tensors are detached and moved to CPU before storage in replay buffer
- Added `reset_memory()` method for complete memory cleanup
- Implemented periodic memory cleanup every 100 training steps

```python
# Before: Unbounded lists
self.losses = []
self.rewards = []

# After: Bounded deques
self.losses = deque(maxlen=self.max_history_size)
self.rewards = deque(maxlen=self.max_history_size)
```

### 2. **Parallel Training Memory Leaks** (`src/scripts/train_dqn_fuel_breaks_parallel.py`)

#### Issues Fixed:
- **No Periodic Memory Cleanup**: Memory accumulated across episodes
- **Missing GPU Memory Management**: CUDA memory not being cleared

#### Solutions:
- Added periodic memory cleanup every 10 episodes
- Implemented GPU memory monitoring and cleanup
- Added final cleanup at end of training
- Integrated experience buffer clearing

```python
# Memory management: periodic cleanup
if (episode + 1) % memory_cleanup_frequency == 0:
    print("üßπ Performing memory cleanup...")
    self.agent.cleanup_memory()
    self.experience_collector.clear_local_buffer()
```

### 3. **Vectorized Environment Memory Leaks** (`src/scripts/VectorizedFireEnv.py`)

#### Issues Fixed:
- **Experience Buffer Growth**: Local experience buffer growing without bounds
- **Tensor Memory Leaks**: Tensors not being properly detached
- **No Environment Cleanup**: Missing cleanup methods for environments

#### Solutions:
- Added experience buffer size limits with automatic pruning
- Ensured all tensors are detached when stored
- Added `cleanup_memory()` method for environments
- Implemented periodic cleanup every 50 steps
- Added performance tracking limits to prevent unbounded growth

```python
# Manage buffer size to prevent memory leaks
if len(self.experience_buffer) > self.experience_buffer_size:
    # Remove oldest experiences
    self.experience_buffer = self.experience_buffer[-self.experience_buffer_size:]
```

### 4. **Matplotlib Memory Leaks** (Multiple Files)

#### Issues Fixed:
- **Figures Not Properly Closed**: Using `plt.close()` instead of `plt.close(fig)`
- **No Garbage Collection**: Memory not being freed after plotting

#### Solutions:
- Changed all `plt.close()` calls to `plt.close(fig)` to specifically close figures
- Added `gc.collect()` after matplotlib operations
- Applied fixes to:
  - `src/scripts/train_dqn_fuel_breaks_parallel.py`
  - `src/scripts/train_dqn_fuel_breaks.py`
  - `visualize_agent_fuel_breaks.py`

```python
# Before: Generic close
plt.close()

# After: Specific figure close with garbage collection
plt.close(fig)  # Close the figure to free memory
import gc
gc.collect()
```

### 5. **Replay Buffer Memory Leaks** (`src/scripts/DQNAgent.py`)

#### Issues Fixed:
- **Tensor References**: Tensors with gradients being stored in buffer
- **No Buffer Cleanup**: No method to clear replay buffer

#### Solutions:
- Added `clear()` method to ReplayBuffer class
- Ensured tensors are detached before storage
- Added CPU/GPU memory management for stored tensors

```python
def push(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done):
    # Ensure tensors are on CPU and detached to prevent memory leaks
    if hasattr(state, 'cpu'):
        state = state.cpu().detach()
    if hasattr(next_state, 'cpu'):
        next_state = next_state.cpu().detach()
```

## üéØ Memory Management Strategy

### Periodic Cleanup Schedule:
- **Every 10 episodes**: Full memory cleanup (agent + experience collector)
- **Every 50 steps**: Experience collector cleanup
- **Every 100 training steps**: Agent GPU memory cleanup

### GPU Memory Monitoring:
- Added GPU memory usage reporting during cleanup
- Implemented `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` calls
- Added memory status logging

### Buffer Size Limits:
- Agent losses/rewards: 1000 entries max
- Experience buffer: 2000 entries max (configurable)
- Step times tracking: 100 entries max
- Collection times: 20 entries max

## üìä Expected Results

After implementing these fixes, you should see:
- **Stable Memory Usage**: Memory usage should remain constant throughout training
- **No More OOM Errors**: Training should complete without running out of memory
- **Better Performance**: Reduced memory pressure leading to better training performance
- **Scalable Training**: Ability to train for more than 60 episodes

## üîç Monitoring

The system now includes memory monitoring that will print:
- GPU memory allocated/reserved
- Agent memory buffer size
- Experience buffer size
- Cleanup status messages

## ‚úÖ Verification

To verify the fixes are working:
1. Monitor GPU memory usage during training
2. Check for consistent memory usage patterns
3. Verify training can complete beyond 60 episodes
4. Look for cleanup messages in training logs

## üöÄ Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always close matplotlib figures explicitly**: Use `plt.close(fig)` instead of `plt.close()`
2. **Detach tensors before storage**: Use `.cpu().detach()` when storing tensors
3. **Implement periodic cleanup**: Add cleanup routines for long-running processes
4. **Use bounded collections**: Prefer `deque(maxlen=N)` over unbounded lists
5. **Monitor memory usage**: Add memory monitoring to critical sections

These fixes should resolve the memory leak issues and allow for stable, long-running training sessions.
